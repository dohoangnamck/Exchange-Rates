### Storytelling Data Visualization  
### The Euro/Dollar Pair
Whatever asset you decide to trade, one of the first lesson your mentor will teach you is to look
at the Euro and Dollar long term trend. Traders persistently try to predict the EURO/USD long
term movements, sometimes ending up in circles of uncertainty.

It wasn't until 1999 that the euro really began its journey, when 11 countries (Austria, Belgium,
Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain)
fixed their exchange rates and created a new currency with monetary policy passed to the European Central Bank. The currency has withstood the test of time, and today the Euro is over
20 years old. US Financial data providers now ask at the start of every year â€“ what will be the
direction of the EURO/USD pair?

This project will attempt to use a storytelling perspective to unfold the relationship between US
Election results and the EURO/USD pair.
